# fledas
Flexible daemon script

Fledas allow you to run a daemon in a linux system in a fast and easy way.
Sometimes you need a quick way to run some commands as a daemon and you can't find a suitable option.
With fledas you only have to define what commands do you want to execute as a daemon and that's all.
